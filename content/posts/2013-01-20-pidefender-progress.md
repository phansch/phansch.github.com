I didn't get a lot of stuff done last week. And I only managed to squeeze in 24 hours of work this week. I did manage to add a new enemy, a new title screen, camera shake and a game ending. I also increased the difficulty a lot.

## What's new ##

 * You can now get killed by your own projectiles
 * A new enemy: The strategic bomber (has placeholder graphics)
 * Camera shake!

## Running the game ##
1. If you don't have Love2D installed, download it [here](http://love2d.org/) and install it first.
2. ~~Download the [.love](#) file~~.

To run the game:
