**Just a quick update. **

As you can see, I sadly didn't get around to update the blog with new posts. That is, first and foremost because I recently moved to Berlin. It's an exciting city and there's so much to see. There's also stuff to be done for [university](http://www.htw-berlin.de/en) which takes up some time. 

Lastly I'm not going to continue to use XNA for future projects. XNA is a good toolset that can teach the very basics of game programming. But as far as I can tell, it's not really a tool set that is common in the industry. For now, I am only writing down some game ideas. Eventually I'll get a hold of C++ and actually finish some games that deserve a place on my portfolio. Until then, I'm playing around with the RIFT addon system. Their addons are based on [Lua](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_%28programming_language%29), which is a scripting language I don't want to miss out on.

Ah, yes: From now on, every post will be in English. I am not sure if I get around to buy an English domain name, so the _.de_ will have to stay for now. As to the old German posts: Right now I don't have the time to properly translate them to English. However, Christmas is near and I will be visiting my parents in North Rhine-Westphalia, so I might find some time to translate them. :)
