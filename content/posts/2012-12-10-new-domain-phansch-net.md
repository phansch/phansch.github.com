I did something stupid when *transferring* my old domain to namecheap.com. 
You see, namecheap didn't offer transfers for .de domains. So I sent a close request to my old registrar.

**Huge mistake.**  
[Apparently](http://www.viewdns.info/whois/?domain=phansch.de), the domain is now located in Greece.
**I no longer own phansch.de.** 

To get everything in order again, I purchased **[phansch.net](http://phansch.net)** and set up proper domain forwarding.  
There's also a new theme, as you might have noticed. It's a mix of [the-pr0gram](http://layouts-the.me.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/themes/the-program/) and Tom's jekyll theme.
