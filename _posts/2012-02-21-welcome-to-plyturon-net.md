Hello, and welcome to plyturon.net! Enjoy your stay.

My name is Plyturon and this blog is my contribution to the Guild Wars 2 community.
I am trying to provide community spotlights, Guild Wars 2 design/mechanics discussions and weekly wrap-ups of Guild Wars 2 news.

At a later date you will probably see guides and useful web applications for Guild Wars 2.


If you have suggestions or feedback, drop me a mail at feedback@plyturon.net or simply use the comment box below.
