title: Participating in Hackership Batch 0
---
Although I sort of talked about this on twitter already, I am happy to announce that I got accepted to [Hackership](http://www.hackership.org/).

## What is Hackership
> Hackership is a self-directed, hands-on learning programme for Coders, Programmers and Software Developers to acquire new skills or become better at what they already do.

> It's like an apprenticeship. But for hackers. A Hackership.  
<small>http://www.hackership.org/ </small>

The program offers a distraction-free environment where you are responsible for what you learn. There 
is no curriculum and no instructors. Instead there is a huge focus on self-directed learning, deliberate practice and reflective learning.
There will be [daily stand-ups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) and weekly demos. Additionally there will be experienced hackers around to help people with difficult problems and to dig deeper into the technology. This first batch will be hosted by [betahaus](http://betahaus.de/).

[Hackerschool New York](https://www.hackerschool.com/about) is a very similar program and has been running for three years already. 

## What and how I want to learn
Primarily I want to learn Ruby on Rails and proper Test Driven Development. I already have an idea on how to get started with this. I will spend the first two or three days working through [this](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) Ruby on Rails tutorial. After that, I will start to work on the actual project where I can apply all the things from the tutorial. Additionally I am going to use [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) cards for stuff that is hard to remember. I will also try to maintain a learning journal to regulary review my learning progress.

## The actual project

Once I'm done with the tutorial, I will start working on a website that helps people learn touch-typing. About a month ago I started to learn touch-typing on the German [Dvorak layout](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Tastatur_dvorak_farbe_optimiert.jpg). I tried all kinds of tools and websites but only a few supported the layout I chose. None of these were very fleshed out. I had a really tough time getting to my current 25 WPM.

</a>

Although I would love to share some more specifics, the project details aren't really fleshed out yet.

## Looking forward
My goal is to get a position as a junior Ruby developer at the end of Hackership. However, I really need to put myself out there. I never did that until the beginning of this month. So apart from Hackership I will try to be at every event possible to deal with my social anxiety. While overcoming my anxiety might sound difficult, I am really looking forward to the times ahead.
