_This is the place where I talk about the progress on my quest on self-improvement. Follow me on this quest to a better self where you might learn something as well. Here's what I did last week in terms of self improvement, focusing on important stuff and getting rid of bad habits._

I finished Week 3 of c25k! I'm really getting into it and I started looking for my first official 5k run as well.
On **Monday** I finished a Geocaching presentation for English class. As English is not my native language I spent almost the whole day practicing my speaking.
**Thursday** was the day where I held my Geocaching presentation. I was quite nervous but according to my teacher there were next to no flaws!
On **Friday**, on the quest to leave my comfort zone more often, I went to uni to study Mobile Applications with a fellow student.
**Saturday** evening my uni took part in Berlin Science Open Door. I paid a short visit to see what people were presenting.
Did I mention that my [tent](http://www.amazon.de/Wildfox-Gjende-1-2-Personen-Zelt/dp/B003D5U4GY) arrived on **Sunday**? Yes, finally! However, all the other equipment is still missing. :(

As for other stuff, I ...



## ... simplified things


Previously, I had my documents all over the place and emails/contacts/calendar only accessible at one computer. This week I fixed that. 
I simplified stuff by using **Google Mail/Calendar** instead of Outlook. I'm also using **Google Drive** to save my documents now. This somewhat saves me from doing regular backups of my documents. 
For note taking I'm using [Evernote](http://evernote.com/). Evernote also lets you sync over different devices. I use Evernote to write up my long term goals, class notes and ideas in general. 
For short term tasks I'm using [Wunderlist](http://www.6wunderkinder.com/wunderlist/), which lets you sync over different devices as well! 
This way I have all my stuff wherever I need it.



## ... got rid of internet distractions


When I'm programming I don't want to be distracted. Once I do something else, I would lose at least 5 minutes by getting into the code again. So I tried to get rid of as many distractions as possible. 
First, I **disabled Google Mail notifications**. I only check my mail three times every day now. 
Second, I got rid of MetroTwit's **Twitter notifications**. This was a HUGE change and an easy one. I don't feel like I want to enable them ever again. 
Apart from that, I disabled **Skype and Steam notifications** as well as several **software update notifications**. 
The next thing was my biggest distraction. The **browser bookmark sidebar**. I can only encourage you to either get rid of the sidebar or remove all the distracting bookmarks. This greatly increased my productivity. 
I also learned that when I have **lots of tabs** open, my productivity goes down. So, for now I'm trying to take a look at my tab count every 5 minutes to cut down on tabs I no longer need. By doing this I'm making sure that I'm staying on one task only.
