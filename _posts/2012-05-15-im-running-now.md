With my move to Berlin, I wanted to change things around. Being a total computer nerd, I would sit at the computer most of the time. I always knew that it wasn't healthy, but there was always something to do at the PC. Things didn't really change until I was done with my kidney treatment at the end of March. But when I left the hospital that day, I went to the city center and enjoyed the sunshine at the Reichstag.

A few days after that, I was still in my old habits. However, two weeks later or so, I was browsing Reddit and stumbled upon [r/GetMotivated](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/).

Here's what r/GetMotivated is about:

> Welcome! We’re glad you made it. This is the subreddit that will help you finally get up and do what you know you need to do. It’s the subreddit to give and receive motivation through pictures, videos, text, music, AMA’s, personal stories, and anything and everything that you find particularly motivating and/or inspiring.

So browse around, ask questions, give advice, form/join a support group. But don’t spend too much time here; you’ve got things to do.

This subreddit is one of the greatest starting points in terms of getting motivated. Seeing the stories of other people on their way to a better life really helped me getting motivated.

	
  * I started geocaching not so long ago. Check out my profile on geocaching.com [here](http://www.geocaching.com/profile/?guid=e229b894-ce8a-4e55-814e-124a63f2cdaa).
  * Thanks to r/c25k I started running and doing push-ups. I will post about my weekly progress here, on this blog and on Reddit.
  * I also decided to start a list of things I want to achieve at some point in my life. These things may or may not include, going to outer space or visiting every continent. ([This](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/tl2ip/for_the_gamer_in_me_i_developed_a_system_that/) post was really helpful with starting such a list)

I won't go into much detail about what I'm planning to because I think that [announcing my goals was counterproductive](http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself.html). No more new year resolutions.

In the past months something changed in my perception of life. I'm not sure what exactly caused that change, but I know that Reddit's [r/GetMotivated](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/) helped a lot!
