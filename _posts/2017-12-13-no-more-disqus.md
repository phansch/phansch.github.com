Disqus has not been working properly for me for quite a while already. The login inside the page never worked and comments randomly disappeared from time to time.

Now, [Disqus has been acquired](https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/zeta-global-acquires-commenting-service-disqus/) by another tech marketing company and it looks like they will be focusing solely on B2B, instead of focusing on their users.

Of course, the same argument can be made for Google Analytics, too. I will [replace](https://github.com/phansch/phansch.github.com/issues/122) Google Analytics with [piwik](https://piwik.org/) by the end of the year. Once that is done, this blog should be free of opaque tracking scripts.
