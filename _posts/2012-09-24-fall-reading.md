The last two months were kinda dull, as I was visiting my family and helping with their house renovation. The past few weeks I spent playing Guild Wars 2 with my friends, but we are done with that for now.
Here is a summary of what happened more recently and what I'm working on right now.

Since university hasn't started yet, I signed up for two courses at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). Coursera is offering hundreds of courses covering all kinds of topics; from biology to computer science. Interactive programming in python was the first course I signed up for. The second is Social Network Analysis (SNA), which has already started. 

Social network analysis already turned out to be really interesting and now I'm looking forward to python as well. Coincidentally, the SNA course allows me to use python for creating and analyzing network graphs, which turned out to be really fruitful - More about that in a future blog post.
