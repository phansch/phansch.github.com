This video from NecroBator and [TenTonHammer](http://www.tentonhammer.com/) shows some of the jumping puzzles that we started to hear about after the press beta event.

This area is part of the open world and is **not** instanced. At the end of the puzzle there is a boss waiting for you to be killed and a chest to be looted. Note that there are different types of traps, obstacles and environmental effects on the way to the top. As this takes place in a level 15 area, we can safely assume that there are more riddles and puzzles spread across the entire map.
