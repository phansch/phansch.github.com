I came here from using Wordpress for over two years. I had two blogs: [one for gaming](http://plyturon.net) and [one for semi-professional stuff](http://phansch.de).
Wordpress is over-kill. I don't need a dashboard, plugins, a media library or a link database. Neither do I need a theme database, a user database or a WYSIWYG editor to create a blog post.
I always want to keep stuff as simple as possible.
Today I pretty much dived head-on into github, jekyll and liquid to create this first post. And it was a blast. Apart from the initial setup, there is almost no maintenance required. Whereas in wordpress, you have
to deal with frequent software updates, backups and broken plugins or themes.
