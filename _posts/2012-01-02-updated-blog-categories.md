I updated the categories of my blog as I found myself writing stuff that didnâ€™t fit into the existing categories anymore.
All old posts have been recategorized by now.
The new structure is as follows:




	
  * General

	
  * Reviews

	
  * Guides/Tutorials

	
  * Motivational

	
  * Programming
	
    * C#

	
    * C / C++

	
  * Game programming
	
    * XNA

	
    * DirectX

	
    * Lua

	



This will also give some hints on upcoming blogposts, I guess ;)
