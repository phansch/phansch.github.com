So I wrote down this list of things that I want to accomplish in 2012. Let me share it with you.
	
  * **I want to get into C++ heavily.** Meaning that I am able to start DirectX game programming at a small scale.
  * At the end of the year I want to have at least one **finished** DirectX 2D project.
  * I want to publish **an addon for the game RIFT** that I am going to support until the 31st December
  * I want to have **at least 52 blog posts** at the end of the year.
