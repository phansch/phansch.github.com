I choose to be the knight.



> When things get dark and tough, and you don't know what to do, you can either sit down and do nothing but wallow in self-pity and doubt, or you can stand up and decide that even if you don't know what you're going to do, you're going to take life by storm. In the end, you can decide if you're going to be the princess waiting to be rescued, or the knight fighting the dragon.
