Recently I thought about how I could make my life even more interesting. I have to admit that I feel quite unmotivated right now. But as I was browsing the internet, I stumbled across a speech from Matt Cutts, which you can see [here](http://www.ted.com/talks/matt_cutts_try_something_new_for_30_days.html).

Matt Cutts suggests trying _something that you always wanted to do_ for thirty days. Luckily I have a huge list of ideas and goals floating around. However most of them deal with computer stuff. After watching Matts speech, I wanted to do something entirely different. 

Stay tuned for more stuff this February.
