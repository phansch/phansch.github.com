Here's what I've been working on, the past couple of days.



### [http://tools.plyturon.net/translator/](http://tools.plyturon.net/translator/)


  


This tool translates any text to [New Krytan](http://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/New_Krytan), the language used by the inhabitants of Kryta in Guild Wars 2. 
The language is based on a very simple substitution cipher. Additionally there is a decimal numeral system in place.
