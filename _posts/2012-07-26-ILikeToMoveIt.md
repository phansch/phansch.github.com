I came here after using Wordpress for over two years. 
I always want to keep stuff as simple as possible: I don't need a dashboard, plugins, a media library or a link database. Neither do I need a theme database, a user database or a WYSIWYG editor to create a blog post. That stuff is over-kill. And that was going through my mind the whole time. 
Today I pretty much dived head-on into github, jekyll and liquid to create this first post. And it was a blast. Apart from the initial setup, there is almost no maintenance required. Whereas in popular blog software, you have to deal with frequent software updates, backups and broken plugins or broken themes.

I will try to write about my experiences with jekyll and liquid as I move on. Here's a summary of day #1:

## Setting up github ##
This is not the first time I tried to get into using github. I admit that previously I had no idea what to use it for. But yesterday I stumbled upon [pages.github.com](http://pages.github.com) and I was immediately intrigued. So today, I downloaded the github app for windows and created my first repository.
