<h1>Public speaking</h1>
<p>I like to give talks and I'm grateful for every opportunity to improve my public speaking skills.</p>

Below is a list of talks I have given so far. If you would like me to speak about a topic at your event, feel free to <a href="mailto:hi@phansch.net">contact me.</a>

<h3>Getting started with open source</h3>
<p>
In this talk you will learn how to find a good first open source project to contribute to. It starts with a quick introduction to version control and then focuses on finding the right project to contribute to.
