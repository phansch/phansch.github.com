My dotfiles repo contains all the configuration needed to setup a new laptop/VM with my configuration. It is tested daily through travis and updated regulary.

The setup script can install i3, tmux, vim + plugins, spotify, virtualbox, vagrant, docker, ruby and much more with a single command.

Please head to the [README](https://github.com/phansch/dotfiles#Readme) as it is more likely to be updated than this portfolio entry.
