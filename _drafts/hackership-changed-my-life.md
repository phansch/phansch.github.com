excerpt: How I turned my life around. About depression, video game addiction and social anxiety.
---

When I [moved to Berlin](http://0:4000/2011/09/29/good-news-i-am-moving-to-berlin-and-getting-into-the-games-industry/) two years ago I moved there with the intention of becoming more outgoing and becoming less anxious in social settings. I was never very popular in class and I <s>pretty much</s> never went out to parties before. In school, I got picked on and bullied. Before Berlin, I was very insecure. So, for me, moving to Berlin was about starting anew. I also moved here to study applied computer science at [HTW Berlin](http://www-en.htw-berlin.de/).

I am a software developer and I love to learn. Usually I learn about new languages, algorithms, frameworks or general programming concepts. But recently I have learned a lot about myself.

After moving to Berlin I didn't know anyone here around my age. Of course I went to university but it usually takes me some time to make friends. At the same time, I felt very intimidated by this big city. <q>*All these people behind their windows and during commute. Everyone of them with their own dreams, goals and aspirations. How in the world could I ever measure up to them?*</q>

What I came to realize is that I only ever compared myself to other people's portfolios. You only hear about the things they are proud of, unless you choose to learn more about their lifes. So, either don't compare your every day life to someone elses portfolio or try to get to know them better.

**Social anxiety**

This is where I need to confess about my social anxiety. Talking to people I don't know is incredibly difficult for me.

**Video game addiction**

If you take a look at the [archive](/archive), you will see a huge gap between March and October. Same for my GitHub history with a huge gap of nothing between March and September:

What happened there was Guild Wars 2. Guild Wars 2 is an MMORPG &mdash; Short for Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game. Those types of games can be very addictive. I knew what I was getting myself into. I have been playing MMORPGs for more than 5000 hours since I was 16. It was a world where I could be what I wanted myself to be. There were no critics and it was easy to make friends. 

Unsurprisingly, I got addicted to Guild Wars 2 as well. I wrote about it [before](http://phansch.net/2013/10/15/fall-update/). I had played the game before already and even had a dedicated blog running &mdash; Some of the articles are in the archive. I played it for a month straight and quit after I reached max-level. I focused on university for the winter semester 2012/2013 and managed to make it through the required tests. 

At that point I wasn't very sure what I wanted to with my life. In my free time I had been developing small video games. And I had been thinking about getting into the games industry [since I moved to Berlin](http://phansch.net/2011/09/29/good-news-i-am-moving-to-berlin-and-getting-into-the-games-industry/).

This time I had found a group of very nice people. The social element plays a huge factor in MMORPGs. Friends can keep you in the game even if you don't like the game anymore.
The last two months were amazing. This post is about social anxiety, depression and video game addiction.
1. Talk about social anxiety first.
2. Talk about video game addiction.
2.1 Also talk about feelings of nostalgia and how old things can't simply brought back

If you think you are depressed, go see a doctor. It's a serious condition and watching motivational videos on YouTube probably won't help.

**I promised a happy ending &mdash; Here it is.**

4 month ago I wrote about learning Ruby:

> I started learning Ruby. Because, why not?

I don't mind to talk about this stuff. Hey, I played video games for half a year staying in my room most of the time and feeling depressed. This is my way of dealing with things, I think.

If you happen to read this post and find yourself depressed or in a terrible place, you might want to read this post. I will talk about what I learned in the last two months
New blog post about how Hackership changed my life
More open and comfortable around people.

If you read through this incredibly long blog post, I want to thank you for taking the time to read it. You might also like what I post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phansch).
