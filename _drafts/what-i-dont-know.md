I have been reading [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382) by Dave Hoover and I found a lot of the patterns really helpful. The first thing I put into practice, was to READ BOOKS and maintain a [READING LIST](http://phansch.net/reading.html).

However, this post is not about that. It's about a different pattern: EXPOSE YOUR IGNORANCE

For example, notice the lack of items on my Ruby and Rails list. You could say that I know a lot about Rails because the list is very short. But in reality, I  haven't really dug deep into Rails and it shows in the lack of specific questions.
Creating this list has helped me realize where I need to dig deeper.

## Ruby and Rails

 * Rails conventions and best practices
 * HAML
 * rbenv
 * SQL Transactions
 * Anything Deployment
 * Tools like [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)

## Javascript

 * Javascript
 * Testing
 * Prototypes

## Tools and OS

 * Vim ctags
 * git bi-sect
 * grep
 * ssh
 * Non-git VCS
 * Tmux session sharing

## General Development things

 * Functional Programming
 * Mocks and Stubs
 * How to calculate the complexity of an algorithm
 * Basic algorithms like QuickSort and BinarySearch
 * The agile process
 * How MVC **actually** (rather than conceptionally) work
