I feel like I have already written enough about the past year. Instead, I want to focus on what lies ahead this year.
This year is all about hacking my comfort zone. This is why I originally moved to Berlin.

### I want to start seeing the world

 * and go on what I would consider an adventure.
 * engage with different cultures
 * More downsizing to be more flexible in case of a move. I already got rid of my gaming PC.

### Productivity
 * Each day, I want to focus on the tasks with the biggest impacts.
 * I want to keep track of repetitive knowledge lookups. When ever I find myself looking up things multiple times, I'm adding it to Anki.

### Health
 * More diverse cooking
 * Sticking to my running routine.
 * Less meat
